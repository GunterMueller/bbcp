Description: IDE for Component Pascal programming language.
 BlackBox Component Builder is an IDE for Component Pascal programming language.
 .
 BlackBox consists of modules, compiler and environment for their work over OS.
 .
 It is also providing facilities for interface design and modules extension.
 .
 Component Pascal is strongly typed and module based. The compiler is very fast.
 .
 Each module is a unit of compilation and execution.
 .
 Modules are brought into memory when specified. There is no need for "headers".
 .
 Symbol files are automatically generated by the compiler for exported items.
 .
 Data structures are automatically garbage collected when no longer referenced.
 .
 The framework comes with a complete set of documentation for each module.
