Installation of required packages in Ubuntu 14.04 (should work also with other Debian-based OS):

	32-bit version:
		sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0 gtk2-engines gtk2-engines-murrine libcanberra-gtk-module
		sudo apt-get install libgnomeui-0

	64-bit version:
		sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
		sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0:i386 gtk2-engines:i386 gtk2-engines-murrine:i386 libcanberra-gtk-module:i386
		sudo apt-get install libgnomeui-0:i386

	Comments:
		'libc6-dev-i386' is required for compilation of 'loader', after build it can be replaced by 'libc6-i386'
		'libgnomeui-0:i386' is required only for run blackbox by 'run-BlackBox-2' starter

	cd BlackBox
	./switch-target `uname -s` GUI
	./build
